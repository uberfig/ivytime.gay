## writing

This past year I've been quite busy but I've started getting more into writing. I've been working on a story I've been wanting to tell for quite some time and I've finally broken past the planning and outlines and into actually writing prose!! I've had a few close friends and some really cool people from the writing club who've been reading chapters as I finish and providing super duper helpful insight and I can't thank them enough. I think with some time and cleaning up I might start releasing the chapters to the public as I feel happy with them but the thought of locking things in is still quite scary so we will see how that goes :3

## sysadmin

I switched to NixOs this year and its made my life sooo much easier when it comes to running things like my jellyfin and throwing in new systemd services for silly little things I've written like [the new hosting software I made to replace the old one for this site](https://github.com/uberfig/ivyhost) which I now self host instead of borrowing a friend's server. Its a nice handy lil thing that makes running this wayy more convenient but I still need to fix a startup issue with systemd but thats not a huuuge deal. 

## software

I've started to really dig into activitypub and I have a much better understanding of it now. I've started working on an activitypub server named [bayou](https://github.com/uberfig/bayou) and have since taken a break to work on a frontend client for the mastodon api using a cool wasm thing called [leptos](https://leptos.dev/) which has been a lot of fun to work with. My goal was to try and build a working client before implementing the mastodon api on the server to better understand how the api works and give me some happy brain juices. I haven't really worked on either project very much lately since I'm pretty tired after exams and am enjoying my time touching snow covered grass over the winter break

## art

I had fun doing studies from chainsaw man and other stuff earlier in the year but I took a break over the summer and haven't done much since. My resolution for the new year is to try and set aside some time to try and draw the characters from my writing to try and better visualize them 

## next year..

next year I'd like to maybe borrow a keyboard from the makerspace and start learning to play and if I enjoy it, look into getting a little midi keyboard. I'd also really like to keep working on the writing and at some point start publishing it. If/when I do I made an AO3 account so I will prob put it up there as well as on my site. I do need to make cover art at some point because otherwise my brain won't let me lol


## media I've enjoyed

**Look Back 2024**

Saw it in theatres with my gf and a couple friends and it really moved me. I was a sobbing snotty mess by the end and Tatsuki Fujimoto continues to be one of my favourite artists of all time. The animation, music, and voice acting were all incredible and everyone involved with that movie is incredibly talented. If you haven't seen it yet this movie is a must watch

**Frerin**

This show quickly became a comfort show for my gf and I. We often would hang together after a long day at her place eating celebratory fast food or snacks and cuddle watching a couple episodes before I had to go home for the day. The show feels so cozy even when it has some super cool fight scenes and a really cool plot. I can't wait for the next season, I need more!!!!

**Arcane**

Ermagersh what a second season amirite?!?! Just when I thought this show couldn't get better it really did, like zamn I was not expecting it to go there. Some episodes were major gut punches and the writing has been incredible. I'm really hoping to see maybe some spin offs or something more just to tie up some loose ends but I can understand them leaving things where they are. It is a truly beautiful depiction of class struggle, war, the bonds that form a family, and what pushes people to their ends. There really aren't bad people in Arcane, just people in bad situations trying to do the best they can with what they have. Its nice to see the humanization and really kept me on the edge of my seat because at times I really didn't have a clear sense of who the "good guys" even were or how things would play out.

**Slay The Princess**

I don't want to say to much about this and dare toe the line of spoiling but this game really touched me. The voice acting, art, music, and writing make this game something that is going to stick with me for a long time. I'm certanly hooked on visual novels now because of it ;3

**Delicious In Dungeon/Dungeon Meshi**

Still can't believe we got an anime adaptation of Dungeon Meshi, its been so nice getting to watch the story again and the voice acting and animation have brought extra charm to the story. Its been really handy since I was able to get my gf to watch it with me instead of pestering her to read the manga. Can't wait for season 2

## thanks for reading!

that wraps up my year in review. I felt like doing one like a journal of sorts since it's been ages since I made a blog post. Kept meaning to make ones but I kept building it up in my head to be bigger than it needs to be so with a little practice I want to try and lower these barriers to working on things and accept that the things I do don't need to be perfect or completely finished and polished, I can just put whatever I want out there and over time what I make will get better with the bonus of being much more authentic to myself 


hope whoever's reading this has a nice rest of the year and a happy new years
