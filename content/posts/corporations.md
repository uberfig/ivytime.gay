I am so damn tired of corporations in every sense

the snacks I buy keep getting smaller

the flavors keep fading in prepared foods

corporate social media keeps pulling features and shoving in ads

the ads on tv are at least a decibel higher than the content 

the billboards along the roads are so bright and colorful they overwhelm my eyes

the endless cracked concrete downtown radiates the sun and makes walking painful 

the endless cars are too loud, I can't stand to be outside 

most of my friends don't even know the name of a single politician for our region, be it federal, provincial, or municipal 

the lights in Walmart are too bright and they buzz

there are no affordable local grocery stores in my city, they died out to Walmart and it's like before I was born 

every brand of bread has way too much sugar and it aggravates my ibs

I feel so suffocated and demoralized but no one seems to care
