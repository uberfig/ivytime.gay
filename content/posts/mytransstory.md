why do other trans people have such cool life stories?

I didn't try on my mom's clothes 

I didn't hang out with the girls at school 

I didn't play with makeup 

I didn't "act like a girl"

I didn't hate my name 

I didn't cross dress

I didn't let myself look inwards 

I didn't get told "we always suspected" when I came out

**I didn't know**

I just felt sad and wrong and I didn't know why.

I was hollow and my emotions didn't make sense

every relationship I tried went sour because I didn't feel anything 

if I didn't get that time during covid to really think, I might never have figured it out. I might have gone my entire life as a sad but ok most of the time, guy

it always hurts when I read or hear some trans person's journey as they recount every instance where it was "clearly a sign" and they were just born in the wrong body and they were basically a girl anyway and...

because of this, I just never related to these few trans people I saw in the public eye. I thought of it as this rare disorder that was for therapists to diagnose

it took me a while to realize it wasn't about who I had been. It was about who I wanted to become
