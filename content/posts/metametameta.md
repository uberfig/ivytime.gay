The Fedi's biggest feature and Meta's biggest threat lies in moderation

Here is a little rundown of what's going on for the uninitiated, you can skip over this if you're already in the loop:

There has been a lot of heated debate surrounding federation with Facebook's latest platform Threads. Threads is a centralized platform made by Facebook with the intent of cloning twitter. The little information we have suggests that this platform will eventually support ActivityPub (the standard that allows all federated platforms to communicate) to some degree sometime down the road. A handful of admins from some of the largest instances were invited to talks with Facebook under an NDA where they received information about the new platform, leading to a level of concern, especially in regards to transparency, from smaller instances and users. 

There are effectively two major views surrounding Facebook's new platform:
1. Immediately defederating from Threads over concerns with the platform (this could be undone in the future and I'll get into these concerns in a bit)
2. Giving Facebook the benefit of the doubt and federating with them right away, only defederating once things get bad

I personally feel that Facebook's platform should be immediately defederated and I'll give my reasoning for this

## (1) I do not believe that Facebook's platform can or will effectively moderate it's users

The Fediverse takes a bottom up approach to moderation. 

- bot spam
- hate ~they let it slide on insta
- misinfo and conspiracy theories 



## (2) I feel it's unlikely that Facebook's platform will share in or copy our norms for content warning

- eye contact cw
- politics cw

## (3) Facebook's platform is a centralized social media platform

yes, it will apparently support Activitypub, but I don't think that matters. People who make accounts on and use Facebook's platform made accounts for that platform. These accounts will be on the Fedi as long as Facebook decides to be open to federation. These accounts will all live inside one giant city and Facebook could close the gates at any time, and chances are, most of the people there wouldn't notice. Federation is just a feature of this new platform, it not the core feature like it is on Fediverse software such as mastodon. 

(4) 

for these reasons I feel a Fediverse that federates with Facebook would be one that is much less comfortable and safe for minority groups 

I feel that those who are strangely eager to federate with Facebook's new platform are trying to weigh the value of growth this platform could provide against how it could negatively change the atmosphere on the Fedi. I personally feel that maintaining the Fediverse's values is much more important than blind growth. Choosing to federate with this platform right off the bat could co
