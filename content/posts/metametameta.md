The Fedi's biggest feature and Meta's biggest threat lies in moderation

Here is a little rundown of what's going on for the uninitiated, you can skip over this if you're already in the loop:

There has been a lot of heated debate surrounding federation with Facebook's latest platform Threads. Threads is a centralized platform made by Facebook with the intent of cloning twitter. The little information we have suggests that this platform will eventually support ActivityPub (the standard that allows all federated platforms to communicate) to some degree sometime down the road. A handful of admins from some of the largest instances were invited to talks with Facebook under an NDA where they received information about the new platform, leading to a level of concern, especially in regards to transparency, from smaller instances and users. 

There are effectively two major views surrounding Facebook's new platform:
1. Immediately defederating from Threads over concerns with the platform (this could be undone in the future and I'll get into these concerns in a bit)
2. Giving Facebook the benefit of the doubt and federating with them right away, only defederating once things get bad

I personally feel that Facebook's platform should be immediately defederated and I'll give my reasoning for this

## (1) I do not believe that Facebook's platform can or will effectively moderate it's users

The Fediverse takes a bottom up approach to moderation. Instances are expected to keep on top of moderating their content if they want to interact with the rest of the Fediverse. Essentially, if you want to present your instance, it must be presentable. 

Instances should only take on as many users as they can effectively moderate as the content coming out of an instance should require minimal attention from other instances. If an instance cannot be relied on to moderate it's own content, this moderation work is offloaded to it's federated instances, each of which must now independently moderate this inflowing content. If an instance is a repeated source of unmoderated content, its peers will usually turn to defederation.

Large instances with poor moderation are a recipe for disaster as they cause our bottom up moderation to fall apart. By not dealing with bad accounts and content, it is left up to the mods of other instances to ban these accounts, effectively offloading the moderation onto other instances. Depending on the scale of this unmoderated server, it could quickly overwhelm small instances and either force them to defederate from the large instance and break up connections or allow for harmful content to be able to leak through. Both of these are bad options and I think that if we can see it coming, we should not federate with a bad instance in the first place. 

"Threads" is yet another owned by Facebook and I would be surprised if they have a moderation policy any different to that of their other platforms. I left Instagram because of the constant hate I found in comments. I constantly reported bot accounts, trolls, homophobia, misinformation, and conspiracy theories and this content was never taken down. Facebook seems to take a very hands off approach to moderation in lieu of maximizing their user count and engagement, there is no consideration outside of legal requirements for how this content is harmful. 

If you are an admin care about the wellbeing of your vulnerable users and the overall health of the Fediverse, you would not accept the tradeoffs that would come with federating with Facebook. I don't know if its just me, but I like having a platform that doesn't tolerate hate. This is one of the very few platforms where I can be confident that as a trans woman, I can open up and not find myself bombarded with homophobia. Today the Fediverse is a special place where weirdos and nerds can hang out and have valuable friendships and connections and I would hate to see this damaged by Facebook.

## (2) I feel it's unlikely that Facebook's platform will share in or copy our norms for content warning 

As a community, we have built a culture of labeling content to make it more assessable and easier for people who are sensitive to specific types of content to participate. There are times where I will feel uncomfortable with eye contact and simply having an eye contact cw can make all the difference for me. Everything from food CWs to CWs for sensitive politics, we make this place more comfortable for everyone. I'm very concerned that federating with this platform will flood the Fediverse and compromise our CWing culture. While this could be sorted out over time, it's unlikely that it will ever be on par with what we have now.

## (3) Facebook's platform is a centralized social media platform

yes, Facebook's platform will apparently support Activitypub, but ***I don't think that matters***

People who use Facebook's platform use ***Facebook's platform***. These accounts will be on the Fedi as long as Facebook decides to be open to federation. These accounts will all live inside one giant city and Facebook could close the gates at any time, and chances are, most of the people there wouldn't notice. Federation is just a feature of this new platform, it is far from the project's core which we can clearly see with the fact that it won't even launch with Activitypub support.

I've heard a lot of talk from a few admins with a "Growth Mindset" that this could be our chance to grow the Fediverse and make it successful. Personally I think that's a load of baloney. The Fediverse is already successful, I've met so many cool people and learned a ton of cool stuff since making a mastodon account. If we try to "onboard" people from Facebook's platform, these people will be expecting an experience that is *the same as Facebook's platform*. I think that trying to "onboard" people to the Fediverse in such a manner will be largely unsuccessful because the Fediverse is not just some knock off/copy/clone of one centralized platform or another, its something new and unique. Federation and decentralization are not quirks of the Fediverse, they are the core features and trying to treat it as something else is a fool's errand. 

## Conclusion

For these reasons I feel a Fediverse that federates with Facebook would be one that is much less comfortable and safe for minority groups 

I feel that those who are strangely eager to federate with Facebook's new platform are trying to weigh the value of growth this platform could provide against how it could negatively change the atmosphere on the Fedi. I personally feel that maintaining the Fediverse's values is much more important than blind growth.

I would recommend that instances defederate threads.net now to protect our community and keep it safe and welcoming for all of us

I would personally suggest the approach of defederate threads.net now and leaving it defederated until we know for certain that it will be properly moderated, comply with EU privacy law, and won't damage the atmosphere we've built as a community. I don't know if Facebook's platform will ever reach such a state, however we have gotten along perfectly well without them, why do we need them now?
