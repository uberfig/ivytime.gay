![pencil drawing of the sol 644 from armored core 6 
its a sleek mech with a humanoid figure 
it has a round head that looks almost like it has cat ears with a bunch of little circles that seem to be a sensor array
it also has big double guns on top of each arm and what look like double jet thrusters mounted on each upper arm
it also has cute pointy feet](/art-assets/2025/sol644_june10.jpg)
