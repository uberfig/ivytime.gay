![digital painting of a character named nomad sitting on a log beside a blue fire
they have glowing red eyes and a respirator and a big poncho with a pack in the middle. they're wearing a cowboy bowl hat and brown combat boots. they're also holding some sort of rifle
the scene is mostly cool blues with the only reds being the character's flat bright red eyes peeking out from under the hat](/art-assets/2025/july-artfight/camp.png)
