<p>why do other trans people have such cool life stories?</p>
<p>I didn't try on my mom's clothes </p>
<p>I didn't hang out with the girls at school </p>
<p>I didn't play with makeup </p>
<p>I didn't &quot;act like a girl&quot;</p>
<p>I didn't hate my name </p>
<p>I didn't cross dress</p>
<p>I didn't let myself look inwards </p>
<p>I didn't get told &quot;we always suspected&quot; when I came out</p>
<p><strong>I didn't know</strong></p>
<p>I just felt sad and wrong and I didn't know why.</p>
<p>I was hollow and my emotions didn't make sense</p>
<p>every relationship I tried went sour because I didn't feel anything </p>
<p>if I didn't get that time during covid to really think, I might never have figured it out. I might have gone my entire life as a sad but ok most of the time, guy</p>
<p>it always hurts when I read or hear some trans person's journey as they recount every instance where it was &quot;clearly a sign&quot; and they were just born in the wrong body and they were basically a girl anyway and...</p>
<p>because of this, I just never related to these few trans people I saw in the public eye. I thought of it as this rare disorder that was for therapists to diagnose</p>
<p>it took me a while to realize it wasn't about who I had been. It was about who I wanted to become</p>
