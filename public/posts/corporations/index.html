  I&#x27;m Tired Of Corporations
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2023-06-11</strong></p>

<p>mirrored from <a href="https://cutie.city/@ivy/110523929241532214">mastodon</a></p>
<p>I am so damn tired of corporations in every sense</p>
<p>the snacks I buy keep getting smaller</p>
<p>the flavors keep fading in prepared foods</p>
<p>corporate social media keeps pulling features and shoving in ads</p>
<p>the ads on tv are at least a decibel higher than the content </p>
<p>the billboards along the roads are so bright and colorful they overwhelm my eyes</p>
<p>the endless cracked concrete downtown radiates the sun and makes walking painful </p>
<p>the endless cars are too loud, I can't stand to be outside </p>
<p>most of my friends don't even know the name of a single politician for our region, be it federal, provincial, or municipal </p>
<p>the lights in Walmart are too bright and they buzz</p>
<p>there are no affordable local grocery stores in my city, they died out to Walmart and it's like before I was born </p>
<p>every brand of bread has way too much sugar and it aggravates my ibs</p>
<p>I feel so suffocated and demoralized but no one seems to care</p>
